Calculate and print the sum of the elements in an array, keeping in mind that some of those integers may be quite large.

Function Description:
 =>Complete the aVeryBigSum function in the editor below. It must return the sum of all array elements.

aVeryBigSum has the following parameter(s):
 ar: an array of integers .

Input Format:
 =>The first line of the input consists of an integer . 
 =>The next line contains  space-separated integers contained in the array.

Output Format:
 Print the integer sum of the elements in the array.
 
Sample Input:
5
1000000001 1000000002 1000000003 1000000004 1000000005

Output:
5000000015

Note:
 The range of the 32-bit integer is .
 When we add several integer values, the resulting sum might exceed the above range. You might need to use long long int in C/C++ or long data type in Java to store such sums.#include<iostream>


#include<string.h>
#include<stdio.h>
using namespace std;
int main()
{
int n;
cin>>n;
long long int sum=0;
long int t;
while(n--)
{
    cin>>t;
    sum=sum+t;
    
}
cout<<sum;
return 0;
}
