#### addElements(classToSelect, classToAdd, offset);

#### classToSelect
name of the class of elements you want to select (string)

#### classToAdd
name of the class you want to add (string)

#### offset
determines number of pixels from the element to the top of the window at which you want the class to be added

and that's it:)
