# Python program to print prime factors 

import math 

# A function to print all prime factors of 
# a given number n 
def primeFactors(n): 
	
	# Print the number of two's that divide n 
	while n % 2 == 0: 
		print 2, 
		n = n / 2
		
	# n must be odd at this point 
	# so a skip of 2 ( i = i + 2) can be used 
	for i in range(3, int(math.sqrt(n))+1, 2): 
		
		# while i divides n, print i ad divide n 
		while n % i == 0: 
			print i,

	# number greater than 2 
	if n > 2:
